# Cat Counter Project
## Introduction
This is my very first project after learning a little bit of JavaScript. The Cat Counter is a simple application that allows you to count the cats you see.
## Features
- Two buttons: one to increase the cat count and another to save and reset the count.
- Displays the current cat count below the buttons.
- Ability to reset the count to 0 for recounting and saving again.
## Technologies Used 
- JavaScript
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
## Motivation
I created this project entirely by myself using VS Code to test and apply my knowledge of JavaScript.
## How to Use 
1. Open the application.
2. Use the first button to count each cat you see.
3. Use the save button to set the count back to 0 when you want to start counting again.
4. The count will be displayed below the buttons.
